# omni.example.ui.scene.widget_info

In this example we show how to leverage ui.scene.Widget to create a ui.Widget that is in 3D.

### The extension showcases view concepts.

Similar to the other ui.scene example, it shows you how to setup the viewport scene in **viewport_scene.py**.
Then there is the Manipulator object that manages the presentation of the item in **widget_info_manipulator.py**.
Finally **widget_info_model.py** manages the model that connects the world with the manipulator.
